You are building a School Admission System where:

Every time a student is admitted, they get a unique admission number.

The total number of students admitted so far should be tracked.

This count of total students should be shared across all student objects, which makes it
 a perfect use case for a static variable.

A static method will be used to display the total number of students admitted so far 
â€” this method can be called without creating an object."
